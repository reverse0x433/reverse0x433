# Hi, I'm Anurag 👋

Backend-focused engineering student with a strong interest in **cybersecurity, systems, and problem solving**.  
I enjoy building backend systems, understanding how they fail, and refining them with a security-first mindset.

Currently focused on strengthening fundamentals in **programming, backend development, and security concepts**.
